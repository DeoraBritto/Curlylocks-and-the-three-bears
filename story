Once there lived a girl with curly hair. Her name was Curlylocks. One day she went into the forest near her house. She saw a cottage and saw that there was nobody in the cottage. A bear family lived in the cottage, they had gone for a walk. Curlylocks went in, she was very curious to know who lived there. The moment she entered she saw 3 bowls of porridge on the table. There was a big one, a medium size one, and a tiny one. Curlylocks was hungry.
